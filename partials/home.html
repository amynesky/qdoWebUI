<h1>Welcome to qdo!</h1>
   <p class="lead"> qdo (kew-doo) is a lightweight high-throughput queuing system for workflows that have many small tasks to perform. It is designed for situations in which the number of tasks to perform is much larger than the practical limits of the underlying batch job system. Its interface emphasizes simplicity while maintaining flexibility. Enjoy! </p>
